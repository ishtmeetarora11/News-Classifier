amazon prime day is back and it will last for 48 long hours prime day will start on thursday august 6 at 12 midnight and will run through friday august 7 in india first introduced in 2015 prime day is a shopping carnival for prime members where they can enjoy lightning deals and deep price cuts across all product categories including smartphones and other electronic itemswith prime day 2020 upon us amazon has already started teasing deals on certain popular product categories such as smartphones televisions and appliances because prime day offers great deals and price cuts on various electronic products it is advisable to avoid buying iphones and xbox consoles now and instead wait for these devices to be heavily discounted during the 48 hours shopping periodif you are an amazon prime member and have plans to shop during this year’s prime day keep a tab on these devices that are likely to be on a discounted list happy shoppingit is not surprising to see the discounted prices of amazonbranded devices during prime day 2020 amazonbranded products are popular in india especially kindle ebook readers echo speakers and smart displays and fire tvs sticks ahead of prime day amazon has already announced price cuts on kindles and echo speakers though at this stage they are not live yet if you are planning to buy an echo speaker or a kindle look out for deals on these products we are also expecting amazon to sell the echo studio at deep discounts during prime day 2020 before you consider the alexaenabled echo studio we would urge you to compare the highend speaker with apple’s homepod that’s not all though you can expect deals on previousgeneration echo speakers as well if you spot a discount on the ballsized echo spot speaker don’t miss it the echo spot is not only a great smart speaker but it can also work as a bedside alarm clockideally diwali is the right time to buy smartphones though you can expect amazon to sell popular mobile phones at heavy discounts during this year’s prime day while apple isn’t always known for discounts iphones tend to sell for cheap during amazon’s prime day this year amazon is sure to discount iphone 11 and previousgeneration iphone xr and iphone xs in fact the ecommerce giant has already started teasing special price cuts on the iphone 11 though the discounted price has not been released yet keep in mind that such deals are only available for a limited period like in previous years amazon will be selling oneplus smartphones at discounted prices we are confident that oneplus 7t and oneplus 8 will be guaranteed to include big discounts though the oneplus nord won’t see any discounts we wouldn’t be surprised to see deep discounts on the galaxy note 10 and note 10 lite during prime day 2020 the big question is how deep the discounts will bethe playstation 4 and xbox one are expensive consoles and most deals on these consoles come only during diwali however this year is slightly different both sony and microsoft are gearing up to launch the ps5 and xbox one series later this year so logically it seems likely that the ps4 and xbox one would get a temporary price cut during prime day so if you are eyeing a ps4 pro or xbox one x you might get some serious deals on the popular consoles in particular the xbox one s alldigital edition should ideally be sold at a discount on prime day after all microsoft recently announced that it would be discontinuing the diskless version of xbox one meanwhile nintendo switch and nintendo switch lite won’t likely see a price cut given that both consoles have been in tight supply since the coronavirus pandemic beganthe demand for smart tvs has been high during the pandemic as most people are stuck inside due to the lockdown in india that said it is a good time to buy a new tv during prime day this year we would suggest you keep a close eye on mi tvs vu tvs oneplus tvs and tcl tvs if brands matter to you make sure to check discounts on sony bravia samsung and lg tvs largesized tvs 40inch and above are likely to get more traction than 32inch tvs just to make sure that you’re actually getting the best deal it’s a good idea to know your requirements before you drop major cash on a smart tv our advice is to read a tv buying guide that helps you familiarise with basic terminologies like 4k hdr oled versus qled dolby vision specific screen sizes for different use cases and more this will make you more confident about your purchasebuying a laptop has never been simple you need to consider the right screen size the internal hardware and most importantly the purpose of buying a laptop with prime day just around the corner don’t pay full price for the laptop you have been eyeing for months if you want a good deal on laptops wait for prime day to begin historically every major pc brand has been consistently participating during prime day and this year won’t be an exception apple may not offer discounts on macbook air and macbook pro but other companies will when choosing a laptop it’s important to think about who will be using the machine and what purpose the laptop tries to solverefrigerators acs or washing machines are those products that you would not want to delay buying if one of them broke unexpectedly ideally there is no right time to buy a new appliance but most people prefer getting major appliances during diwali but the trend of buying a major appliance during the festive reason is changing with eretailers like amazon have been creating hype by launching deals and exchange offers during prime day purchasing a major appliance is one tab away if you are interested in upgrading either a refrigerator or air conditioner you should wait until this year’s prime day to begin amazon promises up to 40 per cent off each on refrigerators and acs while washing machines will start from just rs 6399 the discounted large appliances come from samsung lg whirlpool ifb and godrej among others if the purchase doesn’t manage to meet your expectations you can always return back that’s the advantage of being a prime member,science and tech
the maha giant political mess in maharashtra which 19 days after election results has been placed under presidents rule is a signifier of two thingsfirst the opposition is now open to unlikely alliances to keep the bjp at bay and second regional imperatives are now driving the congress partys decisionmaking away from the gandhi family and the rootless leaders that make up the delhi durbar of the party high commandhow the bjp lost the plot of accommodating regional allies is apparent from the fact that despite their prepoll alliance the shiv sena led by uddhav thackeray balked at forming a government with the bjpthackeray prefers to navigate instead the uncertain choppy waters of trying to form a government with parties who are at total ideological variance with the senathis despite the senabjp alliance scoring a clearcut majority and regardless of the threedecade allweather alliance of the two parties the sena was the bjps first ally and no amount of spin by the bjps embedded media can take away from the fact that the party was unable to form government in maharashtrathackerays total disenchantment with the current leadership of the bjp is in spite of the fact that it jeopardises the senas control of the cashrich mumbai civic body the brihanmumbai municipal corporation bmc has a budget of more than rs 30000 crores and is the traditional source of senas strengthi spoke to a crosssection of leaders who are players in the maharashtra imbroglio and they all pointed to how the bjp under amit shah has reduced politics to a zero sum game of winning at the cost of allies several leaders of the bjp also made the point that allies were upset at the misuse of investigative agencies against political rivals even allies to make them more amenable while every government at the centre has done this it seems to have reached a nadir under the modi governmentsena leaders told me that thackeray felt bullied and humiliated by the bjp in the past six years thackeray is upset that shah unilaterally changed the rules of engagement with the sena and reduced it to a junior partner the sena vote was being cannibalised by the bjp and thackeray felt if he did not act now the bjp would reduce the sena to irrelevance in maharashtrathe bjps other allies such as the janata dal united in bihar are watching the maharashtra alliance breakdown carefully and taking notesthe maharashtra and haryana where the bjp tied up with a rival to form a government results come six months after the bjp won a second term with an absolute majority the results reveal politics is somewhat normal again the bjp campaigned on the article 370 decision with bread and butter issues such as an imploding economy mattering again to votersthe federal character of the polity in india has been underlined by these results for both the national parties congress leaders from maharashtra told interim chief sonia gandhi that the party would split and it would be the end of the congress in maharashtra if they refused to support the senaa canny gandhi who has always tried to build alliances listened to the regional leaders and gave a reluctant goahead sharad pawar ncp chief also told gandhi that it was imperative to isolate the bjp even if it meant allying with the senaseveral unelectable congress leaders who make up the congress working committee tried to counsel gandhi against it but were overruled as 40 mlas from maharashtra weighed in favour of the alliancethis indicates that the hindutva agenda which was the glue that held the sena and bjp together and kept the congress at bay is fraying the sena had grafted hindutva on the marathi manoos ideological plank yet it chose to break up with the bjp right after the favourable verdict on the ram mandir in ayodhyawhile the congress was squeamish about supporting the sena it seems to have decided that containing and isolating the bjp in indias richest state is a more important goalas the bjp becomes the central pole of indian politics expect to see more unlikely ideological alliances in attempts to contain and isolate the party that says a senior congress leader is a good thing for a democracyso what next in maharashtra at this point even chanakya would have a tough time predicting this political humdinger but it can be safely said that the battle is on and indias canniest politician sharad pawar is making his trademark movesswati chaturvedi is an author and a journalist who has worked with the indian express the statesman and the hindustan timesdisclaimer the opinions expressed within this article are the personal opinions of the author the facts and opinions appearing in the article do not reflect the views of ndtv and ndtv does not assume any responsibility or liability for the same,politics

human activities and their impact on climate and the environment may have influenced cyclone amphan in several ways multiple experts have opined climate change appears to be increasing the damage that cyclones cause in many ways including increasing sea surface temperatures that raise the maximum potential energy that a storm can reach increasing the rainfall that drops during the storm rising sea levels which increases the distance inland that storm surges reach and causing storms to gain strength more quickly scientists are discovering a complex relationship between air pollution and cyclones and it is possible that reductions in air pollution in the region due to the covid19 restrictions may have influenced cyclone amphan although they agree this requires further investigation,environment

student protests and caa will make bjp amit shah more popularthe jamia millia student revolt against the citizenship amendment act caa and the national register of citizens nrc has opened up political light for the opposition against the narendra modi governmentthe opposition particularly the congress trinamool aam aadmi party and cpm have found a big opportunity with the student agitation spreading to new areas everyday the fringe parties in kerala called for a general strike against caa today universities with a sizeable presence of the student wings of these parties particularly in the south have responded to the jamia  aligarh  jadavpur students agitation with positive echoopposition parties have jumped into the fray expecting a chance to corner the modi government in a big way which they have not been able to do so far on any other issue be it demonetization gst the rafale fighter deal abrogation of article 370 the intolerance debate lynching over cow slaughter ram janmabhoomi or any other issue it is thus the caa that has become the focal point of the move against the modi government to tarnish its image the reaction of opposition leaders and their open support to the student agitation has exposed their game well in advance as an attempt to spread unrest all over the countythe student agitation on caa in itself is an anachronism for there is nothing in the act that directly or indirectly concerns the student community caa is being painted as antimuslim which perhaps could be the reason for the students from aligarh muslim university and jamia millia islamia to take the leadership of the agitation with the politically notorious jnu and jadavpur universities joining in but this has also exposed the sectarian nature of the revolt now the issue is being sought to be diverted as atrocities of the police on jamia studentsso far the bjp is looking at this agitation with unconcealed glee for the party knows that a provocative opposition response is bound to backfire and help the bjp consolidate its vote base for instance the agitation is triggered by the two universities which unfortunately have a communal image and the issue they have argued is about hurting muslim sentimentthe contradiction in the opposition approach is so glaring as the former kerala dgp dr senkumar pointed out in assam the agitation is to throw out all migrants from bangladesh and pakistan whereas in kerala the strike calls for citizenship to all migrants coming to india the agitation has also brought home minister amit shah to the centre stage of indian politics increasing his popularity and sharpening the debate on the caa any detailed debate will only help amit shah and the bjp firstly the caa concerns only immigrants from pakistan bangladesh and afghanistan it is not in any way discriminating to muslims residing in india as for article 14 it applies only to citizens of india and not foreignersthe plea that while citizenship will be given to hindus sikhs buddhists jains christians and parsis while omitting muslims from the list is sectarian in character is valid on the face of it but as the fundamentalist islamic nature of the three countries afghanistan pakistan and bangladesh sinks into the national psyche the instant sympathy for muslim omission gets evaporated muslims coming to india are not arriving here because of religious persecution many believe that they are coming with some ulterior agenda one could be economic betterment the other and more worrisome to many is the demographic invasion of india with the motive of islamisation of the country many in the bjp believe that muslims are coming and procreating in a big way to make india an islamic state like pakistan or bangladesh that feeling if it comes into public domain will only help the bjp politically moreover the reaction from pakistan to caa has been very similar to that of opposition parties in indiaevery country of late particularly the us and european nations have become very sensitive to migrations from other countries the argument is both economic and religious no country wants its nationality to be compromised in the name of admitting people of an alien culture and countries are wary of sharing their limited economic resources with aliens from other countries people see migration not only as a threat to their ethnicity but also to their job opportunities housing and other economic activitiesthe opposition got exposed on three counts first the jamia agitation started on sunday ie december 2015 what were the students doing in the university on a holiday it shows that the agitation was planned the police video has shown that it is repeatedly asking students to keep peace and not attack public property and stop stone pelting secondly how can an act passed by the parliament be opposed without valid reason by students when it has got nothing to do with youth concerns the idea of the opposition seems to be to make modi unpopular with the youth of india for whom he had emerged as an icon thirdly the police have a duty to protect public property and maintain law and order if outsiders had infiltrated the student agitation as the student leaders are claiming and took shelter in the university premises then the police cant be blamed for rounding them up the plea that police entered classrooms and the library is not convincing as it was a sunday and the university should have been closed the opposition by trying to make the caa the focal point of their antimodi campaign is in a way making modi and the act more popular amit shah has already emerged as the new messiah of indian nationhoodcriminal activities like attacking public property burning down public transport etc on the very first day of the student agitation has dented the appeal of the student agitation blaming the police is one thing but the leaders need to explain the core agenda behind the agitation instead of making it blind hatred

why choose index investing yes the merits of diversification and low cost are usually factored in though one critical benefit that many do not realize is the transparency that is provided in the methodology of an independent index provider to understand what goes into the design and methodology of an index it’s important to note that it’s not a random pick of securities to represent the index’s concept or design so let’s skim through some basics of index constructionindices offer a wide range of options whereby their calculation methods might vary most equity indices are marketcap weighted and floatadjusted where each stock’s weight in the index is proportional to its floatadjusted market value some equity indices are priceweighted indices in which constituent weights are determined solely by the prices of the constituent stocks in the index an example would be the dow jones industrial average then there are equalweighted indices in which each stock is weighted equally in the index there can be restrictions placed in the index where certain constituents are assigned a minimum or maximum weight and this can be applied to sectors as well a few more to add to the variety are options include leveraged and inverse indices which return positive or negative multiples of their respective underlying indices dividend indices which track the total dividend payments of index constituents and the list goes ona common query among many is how exactly is an index calculated is it a simple average or is there some complex formula that runs that magic number the key concept to understand index calculation would be the index divisor in a capitalizationweighted index wherein the portfolio consists of all available shares of the stocks in the index the total value will be a large number eg the floatadjusted market value for the sp 500 is a figure in the trillions of us dollars hence to make it easy the number is scaled down by dividing the portfolio market value by a factor usually called the divisor,business

manoranjan mohantymigrant worker stories have almost disappeared from the newspapers governments are preoccupied with either containing the spread of covid19 or reopening the economy sadly the millions of migrant labourers who were forced to head towards their homes since march 24 are still looking for supportsome got mgnregs jobs in their villages but most of them are unemployed after spending time in quarantine centres they live on paltry ration in unhygienic conditions the fact that containing the virus and resuming production are both connected with the migrants is not sufficiently understood their poor living conditions and unsafe transportation made them victims of covid19 and its carriers further spreading it to towns and villages which are now seeing a surge in caseslet us remember that migrant workers are the key element in the construction sector and industries especially the small and medium industries hence the need to appreciate a few facts and design a policy that goes beyond giving relief for a few months as charity migrant workers have rights as citizens and are major drivers of the economyfirst during the lockdown the health emergency was as challenging as the labour faced an existential crisis due to closure of factories this was evident in the big cities where labour from the underdeveloped states such as odisha jharkhand chhattisgarh madhya pradesh bihar and uttar pradesh were forced out of their premisesestimates on migrant labour vary but most analysts put the figure at about 150 million of whom about twothirds were single migrants if each one has about four members back at home then the total affected would amount to another 400 million this vast mass of humanity faced livelihood displacement and health crisis which is as serious as the outbreaksecond every agricultural labour marginal and small farmer small artisan worker in a small enterprise is a potential migrant labourer when rural economy is unable to provide a source of livelihood the covid19 period brought out this phenomenon sharply the vast majority of them were distress migrants when many of them returned to their villages and after the quarantine period they had only mgnregs as an employment option even though the government enhanced the allocation for the scheme by some rs 40000 crore that is not enough many skilled labourers and youth declined to join that workthe rural economy was not designed to absorb local labour therefore the root of the migrant labour crisis lay in the lack of employment opportunities in rural india which must be restructured with vastly diversified productive activities to absorb local labour thereafter when they migrate it would not be out of distress but bargaining for better prospectsthird it is not appreciated that the migrant labour was the main contributor to the building of urban india the employers use them and send them off after a project is over the few welfare measures achieved in the recent decades after long struggles do not meet their legitimate longterm needs the charity approach was evident when three months after the lockdown the prime minister announced a ‘garib kalyan rozgar yojana’ giving 125 days’ work till novemberin this situation at least two measures are urgently required one is to implement the existing law in letter and spirit and ensuring this by setting up a statutory national commission on migrant labour to protect the rights of migrant workers two is to restructure the rural economy enabling the panchayats to plan a fullemployment development programmeunder the 1979 act and its 2011 rules the migrant workers are entitled to minimum wage displacement allowance home journey allowance suitable accommodation facilities and medical facilities among other things the act warrants registration of labour contractors employers and the enterprises where they are engaged the state governments are obliged to conduct an audit of each establishment to ensure that the law was implementedthe covid19 experience exposed how this law was only on paper and how disinterested were the labour officials to enforce it absence of strong migrant workers organisations made it worse there are also neoliberal labour reforms going on restricting workers’ rights reducing all labour laws into four codes on wages social security and welfare industrial relations and occupational safety health and working conditionson the question of making rural india an attractive fullemployment sector one needs a change of outlook even china has failed in this and is facing a rural crisis rather than making panchayats a channel of delivery of central schemes if they can have the power to plan for comprehensive development giving land and forest rights to the people then distress migration will be a thing of the past,politics

six tips and tricks to play monopolyhere is a list of a few tips and tricks that will help you win at monopolymonopoly is one of those games that most of us can relate to playing in our childhood if not the original version then the rippedoff version called business the board game is now available in multiple variants with an averaging cost of around rs 800 the lockdown situation in the past few months has made most of us look back at games like these and encouraged to play them digitally with my friends and familymonopoly is just like ludo that strikes a lot of nostalgia in most of us the game’s digital variant from hasbro is currently available on the google play store for rs 220 at discount and without the discount it costs rs 350 same for the apple app storeif you do not want to invest in a game and instead want to experience it a few times for remembering old times there is a knockoff version available in the google play store called rento however it is not as intuitive as the original versionpeople might say that monopoly is a game of luck and people skills i would like to differ a bit by saying there are a few strategic tips that you can apply to your gameplay to win the game here are few tips and tricks you can use to take the win over all your friendsbuy as much as you can but do keep a check at your cash reserveinitially you need to start off the game by purchasing as many properties as you can as they will start returning you your money and deplete other players’ cash reserves however you have to be smart with your spending as not all properties are worth it and having some cash on you till the end goes a long way it is suggested that you leave the first few properties on the board as they do not help you recover as much and are the least landed on properties try and purchase the corner properties to have a better chance at the game also do not spend all your money in one go as it is very important for you to have some at all times this could be needed if you land on sobody else’s property or land at the highest roi location and have no money to purchase itbuytrade select properties to stop letting others complete a monopolycreating monopolies at multiple locations is the aim of the game as you would be required to acquire all properties of the same colour and build on top of them so your aim should be to stop each and every player other than you from getting all the properties of the same colour so try and land at places where you see somebody building a monopoly or you can trade with someone to hold somebody else’s property this will help you in stopping the other players from building on those properties later in the game when the other players are desperate and offer you a lot of money for the property sell it to them at a rate which you know will bankrupt them very soonrailroads are cash cowsif you notice a lot of players keep landing on railroads and having more than one provides you with a multiplier without having to build they usually pay more than any oher properties on the map initially making them cash cows utilities on the other hand do not pay as well and are not considered as well an investment as the railroadsuse the jail to your advantageno one wants to go to jail however if you get stuck and have to spend time in jail make the most out of it initially when there are a lot of properties up for sale try and get out as soon as possible by paying off the bail however in the latter stages of the game wait it out for other players to land on your properties and pay rent to you as you are in jail at the time you will not have to visit any of their properties and would end up saving a lotalso read how to make the perfect akira kurosawa video gamestart auctioning when others do not have moneyinitially when everyone has money do not ever auction off the property until and unless it’s a dog and you just want to drive up the price for someone else to make the wrong investment and lose money after a point when only two or three propertiesare left and your opponents do not have much money auction those properties if you land on them as you might have a chance to get them at a lower price than the listing or you can drive up the price so much that the other player comes to the brink of bankruptcy,science and tech

venus is one of the hottest planets in our solar system after mercury now researchers have identified three dozen features on venus which they state could have been created by volcanism if this is true then it will potentially reshape our understanding about the planet and its evolutionthe study was made possible by the help of computer simulations to model the formation and evolution of venus’ ringshaped volcanic structures called coronae in detail the study was led by geophysicist anna gülcher of eth zürich in switzerlandvenus’ coronae are formed by plumes of molten rock rising from the mantle up through the crust this process is similar to how earth’s volcanos function interestingly most of earth’s volcanism occurs along the boundaries of tectonic plates but modern venus doesn’t seem to possess tectonic platescoauthor of the study laurent montési a professor of geology at the university of maryland said that there are still active volcanos present on the planet he adds that they might be dormant but not dead venus was earlier determined to be an inactive planet however now it is being said that the “interior is still churning and can feed many active volcanoes”“the improved degree of realism in these models over previous studies makes it possible to identify several stages in corona evolution and define diagnostic geological features present only at currently active coronae” montési saidthe researchers during the study hunted for young coronae in the imagery of venus’ surface captured by spacecraft like nasa’s magellan probe which orbited venus from 1990 to 1994 with this data montési says that they were able to determine that at least 37 coronae have recently been active all of these young coronae are clustered in just a few regions the researchers state that these regions are interesting targets for detailed investigation by future spacecraft missionsvenus remained active long after mercury and mars became inactive due to which it features far fewer craters than those two worlds which scientists state is consistent with a global resurfacing event that took place around 500 million to 700 million years agoother than venus our solar system’s second inner rocky planet earth is extremely active as of now,science and tech

governors have violated the letter and spirit of the constitution and have in the process gravely impaired parliamentary democracy its conventions and traditionsi sincerely hope that the president will take note of what is happening  the erosion of parliamentary democracy the erosion of the constitution the violation of the constitution  and do what is right in the circumstances he told a virtual press conferencechidambaram said the president has the absolute authority to tell the governor that what he is doing is wrong and ask him to call an assembly sessionthe ashok gehlot government in rajasthan which is facing a political crisis after a rebellion by the now sacked deputy chief minister sachin pilot and 18 other mlas has been pushing for a session of the assemblythe rajasthan congress legislature party clp has sent a memorandum to the president seeking his intervention for convening the state assembly sessionarguing that the governor is bound by the constitution to act on the advice of the council of ministers in calling the session the congress accused him of acting at the central governments behestrajasthan governor kalraj mishra indicated monday that an assembly session can be called at a short notice if the state government says the agenda is to hold a floor test to prove its majoritythe suggestion figures in a note sent by mishra while returning  for a second time  ashok gehlot cabinets recommendation to call a sessionchidambaram said i hope better counsel will prevail and wise people can instruct the governor that he must summon a session of the assemblythe governor has no discretion of his own in the matter he saidchidambaram said if the chief minister who is accused of not enjoying a majority wants to prove his majority he is entitled to call a session at the earliest to prove it no one can stand in his way he saidplacing any obstacle to calling the assembly session would undermine the fundamental basis of a parliamentary democracy he saidhe noted that the rajasthan issue has assumed dangerous and monstrous proportionschidambaram claimed that at least three landmark judgements of courts when the governors concerned acted in gross violation of the constitution in arunachal pradesh 2016 uttarakhand 2016 and karnataka 2019he said despite these judgements and the statements of law the governor of rajasthan has stalled and continues to stall a perfectly valid request of the council of ministers of rajasthan to convene a session of the legislative assemblyit is settled law that the governor shall act on the aid and advice of the council of ministers the governor has no discretion at all in the matter the questions that the governor had raised to stall the request were irrelevant and beyond his authority his current stand that the law gives him a discretion to summon the assembly or not is a complete distortion of the law declared by the courts he saidthe governor he said is only a formal instrument to sign and issue the summons to the mlashe said the congress is astonished and anguished by the attitude of the governor and thus protested outside all raj bhawans in the country to highlight the gravity of the issue and draw peoples attention to the alleged violations of the constitutionwe sincerely hope that the governor of rajasthan will obey the law — and only the law he must remember that he has no other masters except the constitution and the law he must immediately grant the request of the council of ministers and summon a session of the legislative assemblyasked about sachin pilot chidambaram said he has not spoken to him for the last 10 days and now it seems to me entirely that he is embracing the bjphe said pilot should be the first to stand up and call for a session of the assembly and then we will know which party he belongs to and what he will dohe should actually join the congress party telling the governor and everyone please call a session what he will do in the session give his decision but why is he silent about calling a session chidambaram askedthe congress leader also said that gehlot publicly has said that he will prove his majority on the floor of the house and thus he does not have to say in his letter to the governor the governor has no business to ask him what agenda how many days how many hours that is irrelevant he saidasked about intentions of the centre and the prime ministers office he said the intention is obviously a bad intention it is ill intention to pull down the oppositions government but we will resist it we will resist it everywhere a majority government cannot be pulled down if the powers that be think that people are not watching all this they are wrongwe will continue to resist everywhere any attempt to pull down a

without questioning ones beliefs and actions you are only flotsam rebellion against any authority be it the state the monarchy the church or a political party and questioning its orthodoxy is a primeval human urge and the basis of evolution of civilisationthat trait has marked all the great men of the world — leo tolstoy mahatma gandhi nelson mandela martin luther king jr jacques rousseau socrates john calvin buddha and basavanna who distinguished themselves because they questioned and rebelled against dogmas oppression injustice and inequalityin this context you wonder what is it in the dna of todays congress members that no one is ready to rebel and challenge the gandhi dynastyeven after rahul gandhi abruptly resigned and walked away from the presidentship of the party in 2019 owning responsibility for the party’s abysmal showing in the parliamentary elections notwithstanding his exhortations to his party members to elect a new leader no one — neither the young handsome rebels nor the old guard — came forward and demanded elections for a new leaderthe entire flock meekly waited for someone from the dynasty to lead and steer them even if it meant following the messiah over the cliffthe old obsequious coterie grovelled at the feet of sonia gandhi and anointed her back to the throne as an interim president — a ploy to deny congress leaders from outside the dynasty to staking a claimsonia by a fateful default inherited the mantle of the dynasty through a combination of courage resilience cunning and also an astute understanding of the psyche of her flock as well as indian politics she held them together and led the party to victory at the hustings and ruled india for 10 years forming the united progressive alliance upa over two termsshe accomplished that incredible feat through proxy surrounded by loyal henchmen and courtiers who wielded considerable clout even as her son rahul was often an inscrutable loose cannon and a liability a remarkable achievement by any political yardsticknow once again after rahuls exit the party is in the doldrums with sachin pilot leading the dissidents in rajasthan the congress is teetering on the brink and may collapse any time ceding ground to the bharatiya janata party bjp which is raring to topple the wobbly ashok gehlot governmentafter losing karnataka madhya pradesh and now possibly rajasthan this may trigger a domino effect and create an existential crisis for the partythere are multiple power centres within the dynasty rahul is floating in his own bubble relentlessly attacking prime minister narendra modi priyanka gandhi vadra is strutting around mediating behind the scenes with pilot and there is sonia ailing and ageing putting on a brave front but not visible and does not seem effective and in command in dealing with pilot and his fellow mlas theres the invisible clique of her loyal old henchmen who are calling the shots and pulling the strings remotely and the boat is rudderless on

not wish to cure themselves and are unwilling to rid themselves of the yoke what a fall for such a grand old partythe congress does not have to look elsewhere for lessons it can learn from its own

when they question moribund ideas and rebel against authoritarian leadership individual dissent is necessary for the health of any partybose is revered and he still captures our imagination because he rebelled and challenged gandhi and nehru and left the party on realisation that he must found a separate party to fight the british hegemony and occupation of india through means other than nonviolencethose who challenge the status quo either change the organisation they are part of or venture out and blaze a new trailindira gandhi split the congress against the old guard and branched out on her own and was even denied the congress symbol but rose like a colossusindefatigable and fearless mamata banerjee left the congress and founded a new party and singlehandedly demolished the

challenged the old guard and ascended to power and fundamentally altered the character of party of the ab vajpayee timesits a different matter that at times those who replace the corrupt and the old or overthrow despots turn out to be more venal or bigger tyrants than those they replacedthe gandhi family ridiculed and accused of dynastic rule which has presided over its decline and continue to hang on cannot be expected to set its house in orderthere has to be a rebellion within the party to bring about leadership change and breathe new life into it and rejuvenate it for the party to survivethere has to be a robust counter availing political force to question and check the leadership of a political outfit or the state that may run amok to prevent it from decline and disintegrationa strong and responsible opposition party is the need of the hour if the members of the congress do not rebel when the party is drifting headless and is splintering then neither the

amit panghal nominated for khel ratna but doping past may ruin his chances again can india’s biggest medal hope for tokyo olympics in boxing amit panghal 52kg be third time lucky to win a national sports award this year after being nominated for the prestigious rajiv gandhi khel ratna honour by the boxing federation of india bfi on monday seasoned boxer and 2018 gold coast commonwealth games and jakarta asian games gold medallist vikas krishan 69kg too has been recommended for the khel ratna by the bfi vikas had won the arjuna award in 2012well going by amit’s credentials – the 24yearold rohtak boy is a reigning asian games and asian championships meet champion a silver medallist at the gold coast cwg gold winner at the strandja memorial tournament in bulgaria and biggest of them all the 2019 russia world championships silver medallist a podium finish which earned him the quota place for next year’s tokyo games in the 52kg – the diminutive pugilist must definitely hold his firstever national sport award trophy on august 29 2020 when the awards ceremony will be conducted at the rashtrapati bhawan in all its glory amit’s cumulative awards points over a period of four years – for khel ratna and arjuna awards performances between january 1 2016 and december 31 2019 would be taken into consideration – makes him a formidable candidate for awarding khel ratna the country’s highest sporting honourit’s also important to mention here that the indian army – amit’s employer – has already recommended the subedar for this year’s arjuna award the services sports control board sscb had nominated the 2019 ‘vishisht seva’ medal winner boxer for the arjuna for his excellent performances since the beginning of 2018however for the world no 1 boxer in the 52kg category his doping past might again come to haunt him this time as well amit was recommended twice for the arjuna in the past 2018 2019 but he was not considered for the award due to a failed dope test in 2012 for which he served a oneyear ban and remained out of action between 2012 to 2014 according to the sports ministry’s rules for awards any penalization on account of doping offence renders an athlete ineligible for the national sports awardsamit who initially competed in the 49kg category before shifting to a higher weight category of 52kg had tested positive for an anabolic steroid in 2012 and was consequently banned for two years by the national antidoping agency nada the pugilist who was competing in the youth category during those times later appealed against the ban arguing he committed the offence ‘inadvertently’ without any ill intention his appeal led to his ban being reduced to one year on account of him being a firsttime offender“it’s an honour to be recommended for the award it gives you motivation to do well in the upcoming tournaments your confidencelevel reaches a new high while preparing for competitions to bring medal glory to the nation i believe i have sufficient points for the khel ratna and i am a deserving candidate for the award at the same time i am equally thankful to the army for showing faith in me and nominating me for the arjuna army has played a significant role in shaping my career if given a choice between the two awards i would like to hold the khel ratna in my hands” amit told “it’s a dream to for any athlete to represent hisher nation at the olympics i am fortunate to have achieved the quota place for tokyo and i am eagerly looking forward to bringing home the gold i am putting in hard yards to prepare for the olympics however i am not the one running after any award my job is to prepare hard for tournaments and do well in them to win as many medals possible for the country i am an athlete first whatever the awards committee will decide i will accept their decision if they believe that i am a deserving candidate i will definitely get the award my focus is to win an olympic gold for india in tokyo” he addedhowever there’s one strange development amit in his undertaking by a sportsperson nominated for the award to the sscb has declared that “i have never been penalized nor have any enquiry pendingongoing against me for use of drugssubstances banned by the world antidoping agency wada based on a sample collected by the national antidoping agency nada or any other agency authorized by the wada and tested by national dope testing laboratory ndtl or any other wadaaccredited laboratory i have never been penalized for any unfair practice like age fraud etc”the bfi meanwhile has recommended manish kaushik lovlina borgohain and simranjit kaur for the arjuna award for the dronacharya award seasoned coaches chhote lal yadav and mohammad ali qamar have been recommended for the honour for dhyanchand lifetime achievement award category n usha has been nominated while no one was considered eligible for the rashtriya khel protsahan puraskarit’s important to mention here that chhote lal’s name was recommended for the dronacharya last year as well but the coach missed out on the award owing to the conflict of interest on part of his ward sixtime world champion m c mary kom mary kom was one of the selection committee members for the khel ratna and arjuna award last year despite being an active athlete herself with the boxing legend on the committee it was considered by many as a direct conflict of interest when her longtime personal coach chhote lal’s application landed for the dronacharya it had been later learnt that the london olympics bronze medallist had recused herself when coach chhote lal and other names of boxers came up for deliberation during the committee’s meeting,sports

the chief executives of amazon apple google and facebook four tech giants worth nearly 5 trillion combined faced withering questions from republican and democratic lawmakers alike wednesday for the tactics and market dominance that had made their enterprises successfulfor more than five hours the 15 members of an antitrust panel in the house lobbed questions and repeatedly interrupted and talked over jeff bezos of amazon tim cook of apple mark zuckerberg of facebook and sundar pichai of googleit was the first congressional hearing for some time in which democrats and republicans acted as if they had a common foe though for different reasons democratic lawmakers criticized the tech companies for buying startups to stifle them and for unfairly using their data hoards to clone and kill off competitors while republicans questioned whether the platforms had muzzled conservative viewpoints and were unpatriotic“as gatekeepers to the digital economy these platforms enjoy the power to pick winners and losers shake down small businesses and enrich themselves while choking off competitors” said rep david cicilline dri chairman of the house judiciary committee’s antitrust subcommittee “our founders would not bow before a king nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy”in response pichai zuckerberg cook and bezos who testified via videoconference because of the coronavirus pandemic were forced to strike a more humble chord they presented themselves as participants in enormously competitive and fastchanging digital marketplaces and they evaded questions about the decisions that turned their companies into giants“we approach this process with respect and humility but we make no concession on the facts” said cook at the outset of his testimonynot since microsoft stood trial in the late 1990s for antitrust charges have tech chief executives been under such a microscope for the power of their businesses with echoes of the trustbusting of us steel and standard oil more than a century ago and att in 1984 the hearing underlined the government’s recognition that this cohort of tech companies — which wield immense control over commerce communications and public discourse — had become the new trusts of the internet agepresident donald trump also used the event to rail against tech power in a post on twitter before the hearing began he said that he would issue executive orders to rein in the companies if congress did nothouse lawmakers who had opened an investigation into the tech companies in june 2019 made the most of it rep jerry nadler dny confronted zuckerberg with the ceo’s own emails saying they showed a plot to take out a young competitor rep jim jordan rohio said google was biased and asked pichai whether the company would change its products to help elect joe biden for presidentin one of the sharpest exchanges rep pramila jayapal dwash confronted bezos on accusations that an amazon lawyer had lied to the committee about how the company develops its own products she asked him to answer with a yes or no“i can’t answer that question yes or no” said bezos appearing rattledyet while the hearing was ripe with theater any effect will be limited by antitrust laws that were created a century ago and that are imperfect for corralling internet firms since the 1980s enforcement officials have used the notion of consumer welfare as the predominant test for antitrust violations — generally meaning that if prices are not going up the markets are most likely competitive enough the tech giants have generally not driven up prices of digital services or consumer goods many do not charge at all for services like google maps or instagramwhile democrats at the hearing indicated they were more inclined to change antitrust law rep jim sensenbrenner rwis said he did not think the laws needed to change ultimately congress doesn’t have the power to break up the companiesstill the proceedings provided fuel to other investigations of the tech companies by the justice department the federal trade commission and state attorneys general the justice department is expected to soon announce charges against google accusing it of abusing its dominance in online advertising people with knowledge of the investigation have said the ftc is preparing to question zuckerberg under oath in its investigation of facebook’s grip over social networking and acquisitions of nascent rivals“this is a critical juncture in how the washington policy clash with the titans of silicon valley unfolds” said gene kimmelman a former justice department antitrust official and a special adviser to consumer advocacy group public knowledgeregulators around the world are also moving to limit the power of the tech giants europe has led the charge with antitrust investigations and margrethe vestager the region’s top trustbuster recently vowed to take a harder line on the companies on wednesday turkey passed legislation giving its government sweeping new powers to regulate social media contentthe hearing wednesday was a turnabout from just a few years ago when facebook google amazon and apple were emblems of national pride for their innovation and growth but the expanding reach of the four — which are involved in everything from smartphones to ecommerce to digital payments — and their stumbles in misinformation privacy election interference and labor issues have increasingly raised hackleseven so the companies have continued growing as more people live their lives online with all of them expected to post solid financial performances when they report quarterly earnings thursdaythe tone of the hearing was set with cicilline’s very first question directed at pichai “why does google steal content from honest businesses” cicilline asked pichai replied “mr chairman with respect i disagree with that characterization”pichai was repeatedly asked about google’s dominance in search and how the company was potentially trying to keep users within “a walled garden” he said google had many competitors for specific categories of search such as shoppingzuckerberg was asked about facebook emails in which executives discussed the company’s 2012 acquisition of instagram as a possible strategy to take out a nascent competitor zuckerberg said that in fact instagram’s success had never been guaranteed and was the result of facebook’s investment in the productwhen lawmakers asked bezos if amazon had bullied small merchants he said that it was “not how we operate the business” — before being confronted

in 2016 when a transman in kolkata underwent a genderconfirmation surgery it took nearly five months for the private sector bank —  where he worked —  to verify and change his identity proof documents “the process was long and tedious and it cost me rs 25 lakh which is why i believe all organisations including banking and financial institutions need greater sensitisation and extend such cover for all employees irrespective of their gender and expression” he saidfortunately aditya mk a transman from bengaluru could avail sex reassignment surgery in 2017 by utilising his company a leading it consulting firm’s insurance policy that covered the cost up to rs 3 lakh “i came out to my company at the end of december 2016 around the same time when they started introducing wellness policies that included the trans community they supported me and i did not face any harassment” said the 30yearold who quit to join another firm two months agoit is only recently that the corporates have begun to expand their employee welfare schemes aptly named ‘diversity and inclusion policies’ to include employees from the lgbtq spectrum in a step forward for the lgbt community such policies extend medical coverage leave benefits besides establishing genderneutral washrooms and mandatory sensitisation driveswhile multinationals started or expanded corporate programmes to address concerns of lgbt employees in the workplace in india starting from 2016 a year after homosexuality was decriminalised by the supreme court it is only now that more companies are leaning towards a change that could cascade into something biggerrecently diageo india rolled out an “enhanced wellness policy” for all employees effective july 2020 regardless of sexual orientation gender identity or expression including lgbtas part of the company policy “medical coverage and leave benefits are to be extended to both same sex and oppositesex domestic partners” it also provides medical coverage for gender confirmation procedures similarly surrogacy and fertility treatment medical benefits will be made available for all employees “in the newly enhanced policy we have revised and expanded the definition of ‘family’ to include ‘same sex’ and ‘livein’ partners we want to alleviate unnecessary stress and provide support to the individual and their family through financial and emotional support thereby providing them an environment where they can thrive and be their best personally and professionally” aarif aziz chief human resource officer diageo india told indianexpresscomhasn’t this been a long time coming “change does not happen overnight for lgbt inclusiveness the change must take place at all levels — individual family societal governance and even at the workplace change may be slow but that does not stop us from putting in efforts” remarked aziznotably with the striking down of section 377 of the indian penal code to exclude all kinds of adult consensual sexual behaviour the supreme court’s judgment emphasised the fundamental right of homosexual persons to live with dignity without the stigma attached to their sexual orientation with equal enjoyment of rights under india’s constitution and equal protection under the law this was later emphasised by the united nations as well observing that violence and discrimination against the community cannot be “ended by governments alone” in their standards of conductun high commissioner for human rights zeid ra’ad al hussein noted in a 2017tweet that businesses will not only have to meet their human rights responsibilities “they must become active agents of change”l’oréal india which is the only fmcg company in the country that has been awarded the advanced edge economic dividends for gender equality move level certification for gender equality has inclusivity policies like medical insurance that covers employees with same sex partners “our lgbtqi employee base feels respected valued and entitled to every opportunity and benefit that any other employee would our culture allows for equal opportunity and fostering workplaces where all people of every ethnic and social background every religion gender age or disability feel appreciated and valued” said roshni wadhwa director human resource l’oréal india notably this year the company launched the employee human rights policy “with the principle of nondiscrimination particularly for the lgbtq community” and covering aspects like hiring remuneration access to training company benefits and services promotions terminations or retirementbut how do such policies translate into a “more inclusive workplace“ “workplace inclusiveness is equality comfort fairness and joy for all – regardless of who they are it could be who they are as a demographic or who they are within the firm core or support functions senior or junior levels to us inclusiveness is just that – every person feeling equally free equally valued and equally respected no matter who they are or where they come from we hence actively discourage ourselves from undertaking diversity and inclusion di initiatives in silos – while special focus is needed at the same time for us every di initiative culture initiative antiharassment initiative is also within the broader unifying umbrella of ‘engaging respectfully’” said seema bansal who leads boston consulting group’s bcg social impact practice in asia pacific and is a member of the firm’s people and organisation and public sector practicesshe also stressed how it is the “training sensitisation communication and dialogue” with the rest of the office – “that is most critical” “conversation on biases – conscious and unconscious training on respect and space are a core part of our di efforts” she addedwadhwa also explained some of the practices followed besides workshops “we conduct regular audits which are both physical as well cultural wherein l’oréal is evaluated on parameters to determine how accessible it is for employees and what kind of policies and practices we have to enable diversity at work” she saidleveraging methods and channels like film screenings interactive presentations workshops performances participation in external events besides their inclusivity policy global software consultancy thoughtworks has begun proactively hiring from the lgbtq community “this is an incredible time in the evolution of true inclusion at the workplace in partnership with periferry an organisation that works for the empowerment of transpeople we have launched prajna a mentorship

surgery policy can be availed by employees “free of cost and takes a 360degree approach making sure that everything from logistics to medical expenses counselling and mental health is taken care of”organisational and leadershipdriven initiatives coupled with sensitisation workshops and pride month celebrations can drive lgbtq inclusion and the nurturing of a safe space for the community it is

a gamechanger pawan dhall gender and sexuality activist and researcher is concerned about the minuscule number of employees availing such services “if the employee avails of the service tongues may start to wag which becomes a ground for discrimination at many places this discourages many from opting for them the onus is therefore on the hr department to maintain complete confidentiality in all cases” he saidhighlighting that setting a clear policy for inclusion is a strong message ambika sharma founder and managing director pulp strategy noted that “being inclusive is good business““you don’t have to give up on talent which is what hiring should be focused on in the first place differentiating on grounds of anything else other than talent and potential is just bad business apart from being dated it’s a very good start most policies are backed by sensitivity training and strong communication if done in tandem it is an effective measure it does take time to change mindsets and thus

five highlights of the antitrust hearing against big tech in the usthe ceos of apple amazon facebook and google faced an onslaught of questions posed by a 15member panel of democratic and republican lawmakers at the historic hearing on capitol hillthe ceos of four of the world’s largest technology companies faced an onslaught of questions posed by a 15member panel of democratic and republican lawmakers at the historic congressional antitrust hearing on wednesday where they faced condemnation for having “too much power”during the fivehour virtual hearing on capitol hill the “emperors of the online economy” — amazon’s jeff bezos apple’s tim cook facebook’s mark zuckerberg and google’s sundar pichai — were accused of allegedly abusing their power by misusing data and stifling competition in their bid to dominate the marketthe hearing in washington marked the culmination of a yearlong investigation by the congress’ top lawmakers which raked up millions of documents and hundreds of hours worth of recorded testimony from all four tech giantsin a rare act of bipartisanship democratic and republican lawmakers were able to find something that they agree on — they collectively believe that the us’ centuryold antitrust laws are in desperate need of an upgrade while democrats accused the companies of crushing their competitors by misusing data republicans claimed that the firms displayed an implicit anticonservative bias“these companies as they exist today have monopoly power some need to be broken up all need to be properly regulated and held accountable” the house judiciary committee’s democratic chairman and rhode island rep david cicilline saidhere are some highlights from the historic antitrust hearingdemocrats accuse amazon of using seller data to develop its own competing productsfor years governments across the world have accused prominent technology companies like apple amazon facebook and google of choking small businesses and stifling competition either by acquiring their competitors or obliterating potential threats entirely by making competing productsat wednesday’s congressional hearing all four chief executives were asked about their alleged missteps in approaching competitors amazon ceo jeff bezos in particular faced an onslaught of questions about his companies’ alleged use of thirdparty seller data to develop its own competing products — an allegation first laid out in a report by the wall street journal this yearquite unexpectedly bezos admitted that amazon may have misused seller data to develop its products this is the first time that an admission of this sort has been made by the company previously representatives of the eretailer have categorically denied these allegationsresponding to a question posed by democratic rep pramila jayapal of washington’s 7th district bezos said “we have a policy against using sellerspecific data to aid our private label business but i can’t guarantee you that that policy has never been violated”the company was also criticised for its aggressive approach towards acquiring small companies that it sees as a threatquestions were raised about amazon’s acquisition of diaperscom in 2011 when the online baby product retailer was initially reluctant to sell amazon began drastically cutting prices on baby products ultimately diaperscom was forced to shut shop after amazon managed to capture its market share“i don’t remember that at all” bezos respondedzuckerberg questioned over emails when facebook acquired instagrammark zuckerberg came under fire for emails he sent to other facebook executives in 2012 where he stressed on the need to acquire photosharing app instagram zuckerberg claimed the app could become “very disruptive” to facebook in a series of emails which were later accessed by the house judiciary committee as part of their investigationin what was then its largest acquisition facebook bought instagram for about 1 billion in cash and stock in april 2012 the app had around 30 million users at the time instagram now has well over 1 billion monthly active usersrep jerry nadler accused zuckerberg of violating antitrust laws by acquiring a competitor to neutralise the threat that it posed during the hearing he said the emails exchanged by zuckerberg and his colleagues “told a very disturbing story”“if this was an illegal merger at the time of the transaction why shouldn’t instagram now be broken off into a separate company” nadler askedresponding to the democrat’s allegations zuckerberg claimed he has always maintained that facebook viewed instagram as “both a competitor and as a complement” to its services “at the time almost no one thought of them as a general social network” he addedrepublicans say tech companies have ‘liberal bias’ ohio republican jim jordan claimed that the big four tech companies were “out to get conservatives” he claimed that conservative voices were often censored on online platforms which allegedly favour liberal thought“big tech is out to get conservatives that’s not a suspicion that’s not a hunch — that’s a fact” he said he cited several instances of alleged censorship during the hearing — among them were president donald trump’s twitch account being suspended over “hateful conduct” google’s ad platform threatening to restrict the rightleaning online publication the federalist and youtube taking down videos that contain information which goes against who recommendations“we’re 97 days before an election and the power – as the previous chairman and ranking member have said – the power these companies have to impact what happens during an election what american citizens get to see before their voting is pretty darn important’ he saidflorida republican rep gregory steube claimed that campaign emails sent to supporters were often blocked or sent directly to gmail’s spam folder“there’s nothing in the algorithm that has anything to do with political ideology” google ceo sundar pichai said in response “we do get complaints across the aisle”google accused of stealing content from small businesses the house judiciary committee’s democratic chairman david cicilline accused google of creating a “walled garden” and engaging in “anticompetitive” practices by stealing content from smaller businessesgoogle was accused of stealing thousands of reviews from yelp and also closely monitoring web traffic to keep its competitors in checkdenying the allegations pichai said “today we support 14 million small businesses supporting over 385 billion in their core economic activity we see many businesses thrive particularly even during the pandemic”apple accused of favouring developers on app store apple ceo tim cook was questioned about whether some developers were favoured over others on the app store democratic rep lucy mcbath of georgia asked cook why the platform took down external parental control apps like ourpact soon after apple introduced its own service screen time“we were concerned congresswoman about the privacy and security of kids” cook said in response he claimed that the ourpact act was vulnerable to thirdparty takeovers “so we were worried about their safety” he addedcook claimed that apple’s guidelines for its app store were “open and transparent” and applied “evenly to everyone”,science and tech

apple inc chief executive officer tim cook will tell us lawmakers probing his company’s market power that the iphone maker’s app store has opened the “gate wider” for developers and doesn’t stifle competitionin a prepared opening statement for wednesday’s hearing in the house antitrust subcommittee the longtime apple executive positions the cupertino californiabased technology giant as a “uniquely american company” that does “not have a dominant market share in any market where we do business” he cited google samsung electronics co and lg electronics inc as examples of competitors in the smartphone market“as much as we believe the iphone provides the best user experience we know it is far from the only choice available to consumers” cook’s testimony reads critically he says that while apple believes regulatory scrutiny is reasonable the company will “make no concession on the facts” and disputes the characterization that apple is anticompetitive“after beginning with 500 apps today the app store hosts more than 17 million — only 60 of which are apple software” cook says “clearly if apple is a gatekeeper what we have done is open the gate wider we want to get every app we can on the store not keep them off”regarding concerns that apple takes too large a commission from developers who sell through the app store cook says that the store was launched in 2008 to mimic a highend department store with a carefully curated selection of products he also says the store is unique in its pricing structure and offers a better option than what previously existed for developers“when the app store was created the prevailing distribution options available to software developers at the time did not work well” cook says in his testimony “brickandmortar stores charged high fees and had limited reach physical media like cds had to be shipped and were hard to update”in the remarks cook says that the “vast majority of apps on the app store” provide their developers with a 100 revenue share and apple’s 15 to 30 cut beat the boxed software industry and is competitive with alternatives he also said the revenue share has evolved“in the more than a decade since the app store debuted we have never raised the commission or added a single fee in fact we have reduced them for subscriptions and exempted additional categories of apps” cook wrote “the app store evolves with the times and every change we have made has been in the direction of providing a better experience for our users and a compelling business opportunity for developers”,science and tech

congress interim president sonia gandhi’s praise of former prime minister late pv narasimha rao has been heralded as a significant departure by the congress leader from her past position and perhaps a course correction to do justice to one of the most reformist prime ministers who shaped the economy to what it is todayis it because sonia gandhi has belatedly realised the pitfalls of ignoring the contributions of rao which could be an attempt to win over some sections of voters there is nothing to show that sonia gandhi and her family or top congress leaders have done a reassessment of the importance of rao’s legacy for revival of the partyhowever what is clear is that in the absence of any respect shown towards rao’s memory among the present generation of the congress leaders other political parties particularly the bharatiya janata party bjp and the telangana rashtra samiti trs have not hesitated to honour the late leader who had his share of ups and downs while he was prime minister from 1991 to 1996what we do know is that the immediate reason for sonia gandhi and her son and former congress president rahul gandhi to issue statements honouring rao — 15 years after his death — has had a lot to do with a desperate sos sent by telangana congress chief uttam kumar reddystruggling as he is with the task to revive the congress in the state reddy cautioned his bosses in delhi about their political rivals out to completely appropriate the name fame and legacy of rao who is considered a great son of the soil in both andhra pradesh and telanganahence the inauguration of the yearlong centenary celebrations of rao organised by the congress’ telangana unit — in competition with the trs — was a perfect foil to send the right signalbesides july 24 marked the 29th anniversary of the epochmaking 1991 budget presented by manmohan singh who was then the finance minister in rao’s government the 1991 budget is hailed as the harbinger of liberalisation in indiasince 2014 the congress has been at its wits’ end in telangana after it ceded ground to trs leader and chief minister k chandrasekhar rao kcr kcr has taken full credit for the bifurcation of andhra pradesh into telangana and a smaller andhra pradesh when the bifurcation was actually done by the congressled united progressive alliance upa government in the hope that it will enable the congress win the 2014 assembly polls in both the states however kcr walked away with the cakekcr has kicked off the yearlong centenary celebrations of rao by demanding india’s highest civilian award the bharat ratna be conferred on the former pm the local congressmen have also seen kcr trying to woo the rao family by promising an mlc seat for one of them the bjp too has not been far behind in this regard in 2014 raos grandson nv subhash had joined the bjp last year prime minister narendra modi chided the congress for having ignored raos contributiongiven this scenario can the congress afford to lose the battle for a slice of rao’s legacy at least in telangana yet these statements by sonia gandhi and rahul gandhi in praise of rao do not give the impression of a change of heart it’s more like water off the duck’s backover the past 15 years rao’s contributions have remained obliterated by the congress this is not because sonia gandhi cannot forgive rao’s past acts as prime minister that did little to improve their personal equations or salvage the promuslim credentials of the congress in the wake of demolition of the babri masjid in ayodhya in 1992 in addition to this rao was the union home minister in 1984 when the antisikh riots took place after the assassination of indira gandhithose were low points for rao and he was blamed for the congress losing its ‘secular’ plank after his government failed to protect the 1992 demolition at ayodhya this meant that rao was relegated to the margins of the party even banished of sorts therefore rao cannot be the ultimate selling point for the congress in north indiamore importantly there is no love lt for him sonia gandhi may have chosen rao as prime minister after the congress secured enough numbers to form government after the 1991 elections however rao was not the first choice being reluctant to take charge herself sonia gandhi’s first choice was shankar dayal sharma who was then vice president but his failing health did not fit the billrao was not moulded as a congressman who thought it necessary to genuflect at 10 janpath as years rolled by rao’s interactions with sonia gandhi began to drop even as the former’s detractors added fear and bitterness to their growing distance between the twothese detractors fed sonia gandhi with stories about rao’s alleged plot to destabilise her and about the possibility that investigations into the bofors scam would be reopenedsonia gandhi forayed into politics only in 1998 after sitaram kesri had cleared the stables for her ironically rao had chosen kesri to succeed him as congress chief but the latter lost no time to downsize rao rao later admitted to this author that he had made a mistake in giving up the post of congress chief finally kesri was himself shown the dooras expected rao did not find a place in sonia gandhi led congress working committee cwc despite him having been a former prime minister once she took full charge rao had to pay even a heavy price and faced humiliation on many occasions — until his death in 2004 by which time sonia gandhi had led the party back to power by forming the upahistory is witness that a day after his death rao mortal remains was not allowed inside the aicc headquarters at 24 akbar road in new delhi — it’s an honour given to congress leaders and rao was denied that even though he was a prime minister rao was cremated in hyderabad and it is alleged that sonia gandhi’s close aides were behind these moves however in 2015 rao got a memorial at ekta sthal in delhi,politics

it is high time that the congress appoints a fulltime president by selection or election party leader sandeep dikshit said on sunday asserting that the congress working committee cwc comprising senior leaders should have settled the leadership issue earlier dealing with it on prioritythere is a sense of drift and a feeling that we need to get on with the job in the party with an interim president at the helm dikshit saidin an interview to pti the congress leader said that for him there was no particular fixation with any person and rahul gandhi or anyone else could be appointed by selection or election but the important thing is that the party needs a fulltime presidentdikshits remarks assume significance as sonia gandhi nears completion of oneyear as interim congress president in early august and the party is abuzz with hectic parleys on the way forwardhe also hit out at jyotiraditya scindia for switching to the bjp and sachin pilot for his rebellion in rajasthan asserting that the fight was not between the young and the old in the party but between the usurpers and those persevering through hardworkmuch as i would say that mrs sonia gandhi is doing a very able and commendable job as president one of the reasons that she left earlier was that she felt that it is time for her to take to the background and for other people to take over in her case it was mr rahul gandhi dikshit saidheres an interim arrangement interim is a very iffy word because you know if you are interim you wont take longterm decisions for the congress so it is high time we get a full time president whoever it is the 55yearold former mp saidwhether it is through selection or election there is no issue he saidwe should have a fulltime president whether it is mr a or mr b or mr gandhi that is not an issue at all party ideology and collective leadership make a party dikshit saidhe said initially it was thought that the cwc the partys highest decision making body will come together and select a president or maybe among themselves elect one but that has not happenedit is not a bad idea to leave it open to the all india congress committee aicc where one can also have an election to the working committee he saidit appointment of fulltime president should have happened earlier i constantly maintain that here is the place where i point towards the inability of our senior leaders cwc members to have risen to the challenge got together and got this thing done dikshit saidmr gandhi very clearly made a statement that i am not coming back then what were you senior leaders busy doing running around and not being able to decide he said adding that they should have got the process donenoting that the cwc could not agree on one name and so it decided sonia gandhi should become interim president dikshit also pointed towards scindia and pilot for not taking a stand then as cwc members and enable a decision either then or later whenever the partys top decisionmaking body metall these people in the cwc including the scindias and pilots why couldnt they have fought for and enabled selection or election of a new president at that time these people can do a revolt when it comes to personal ambition but they could not risk their careers when it came to the party he saidasked if rahul gandhi should come back as party chief in the prevailing circumstances dikshit said whoever comes will do well for the congressif it is mr gandhi i will follow him if it is someone else i will follow that person no particular fixation with any particular person i am an aicc member i have one vote which if needed will be cast on my conscience he assertedearlier this year dikshit son of threetime delhi chief minister sheila dikshit had voiced his opinion that the leadership issue must be settled and had asserted that the senior leaders must step uphis remarks come amid the crisis being faced by the party in rajasthan with pilot openly rebelling against the ashok gehlot government which comes close on the heels of scindia toppling the congress government in madhya pradesh by switching over to the bjp with mlas supporting himtalking about the backtoback scindia and pilot episodes that have rocked the congress dikshit said there is no such thing as the young vs old and these were the result of personal ambitions basically it is their calculation their self assessment and what they think they are i dont know about mr pilot because we do not know what he is going to do i think it is a little premature to say anything he saiddikshit however added that both have shown all the weaknesses that political beings can haveasked if rahul gandhis stepping down as party chief had heightened insecurities among the younger leaders in the party he said it heightened the insecurities only of those who wanted to climb on his tailcoaton why gehlot or kamal nath were selected as chief ministers over their younger colleagues he said that this question should not be asked of rahul gandhi or anyone else but to the party mlas in the respective congress legislature parties more mlas are with kamal nath than with scindia more mlas are with gehlot than with pilot so it is the mlas decision dikshit assertedcriticising scindia dikshit said that despite the royal scion losing the lok sabha he was offered the post of state party chief and a nomination to the rajya sabhafor someone who claims to be a peoples leader he should have accepted peoples verdict in the lok sabha and had the ability to remain without the trappings of power fought for the party on the field and won back his seat for the partymrs gandhi offered him to become pcc pradesh congress committee chief in november last year scindia never came back with a yes so what did he want we couldnt have put him in place of mr narendra modi dikshit quipped,politics
